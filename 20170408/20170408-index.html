<H1>Today's project is brought to you by the great folks at 
<a href = "http://www.TeamTreeHouse.com">TeamTreeHouse.com</a></H1>
<br>
<p>Because I was struggling so much with my current program of cousework I have
 returned to these guys to help augment the lackings and improve my 
 understanding of AngularJS.</p>
 <br>
 <p>I hope that this will work...otherwise I may be forced to close and delete 
 this repo and start over with a one-a-day-on-github.</p>
