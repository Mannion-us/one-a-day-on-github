<body><h1>Today is 20170215...</h1>
<p>Because today was so rough I am electing to make this entry as short and as
accurate as I can so the links will be directly back to the project index.html
and the past two days' branch folder's index.html files.</p>

<p>My plan is to begin making visual changes to pages as part of my upward move
on this learning curve...so watch for things like table data presentation...as
part of my HTML learning and then color styling as part of my CSS ( inline ).
