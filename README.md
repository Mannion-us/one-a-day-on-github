# one-a-day-on-github

This Repository is my learning curve ledger...day one and counting!!!

This is a new project idea that should have me writing code each and every day.

It was based on the concept of a one-a-day pill that should make me stonger
with each day.  The intent is to create one new from scratch html project that
requires me to create all files in the day's directory from scratch.

The structure will be based on this one readme file, WPI commits on everything,
a single file index.html that like this readme.txt file will have to be 
updated each and every day.

This process should not take more than one 20 minute session each day and
concepts can come from anywhere including sources like code wars and may even
include a copy of my current checkpoint work for where I am on any given day in
my bloc.io coursework.

It is also intended for me to start showing that I am coding MORE on my github
repository because with multiple commits on this one project it will show my
status as a coder as HEAVY.

My real attempt is to improve my skill development, to shorten my recall time
for basic concepts, to develop a track record on github, and on my calendar for
the actual amount of time I am writing code at the keyboard.

It may take some time to improve myself but I need to start somewhere other
than just trying to get through my bloc.io coursework.

So now I have created this repo on github so that master will include my git
commands practice...

This update was for today's multiple actions that I failed to break down into 
individual "commit" messages.  There was so much that I did that I forgot to 
track it all as I went.

Created this README.md file ( edited several times ).  It was created in part
by github.  I then cloned this repository to my local directory.

Created an index.html file for the parent directory as an index to be
updated daily with each new day's directory information and links to the index
of that day.

Created a subdirectory for the day using the following convention:
year,month,day as in this example:  20170212.

Created an index file within that subdirectory and populated it with
some details and a link back to the project's parent directory's index.html
file.

Created a single commit message and then updated this file.

Will follow this edit with one additional commit message reflecting details.

This update followed the "commit" where I was reviewing it all on github.

I noted two typos:

One in the parent directory index.html file.  Second in the commit message.

I have elected to skip the second since I have already made at least one commit
since the error was made and I do not wish to "play" that hard at this time.

The second typo error I can correct now in the index.html file and make a new
commit after the change.  I will be making two commits here and now.  One for
this README.md file edit and one for the index.html file edit.  What will
follow will like be an additional update to this file and a follow up commit.

This for a total of three additional commits made to today's total count.

Edited this file.  Added WIP folder and sub folders with files.  Updated all
index.html files to reflect correct paths in the anchors.  Git Add . and then
git commit -m "adding message to reflect same..."
