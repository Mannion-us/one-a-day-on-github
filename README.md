# one-a-day-on-github

This Repository is my learning curve ledger...day one and counting!!!

This is a new project idea that should have me writing code each and every day.

It was based on the concept of a one-a-day pill that should make me stonger
with each day.  The intent is to create one new from scratch html project that
requires me to create all files in the day's directory from scratch.

The structure will be based on this one readme file, WPI commits on everything,
a single file index.html that like this readme.txt file will have to be 
updated each and every day.

This process should not take more than one 20 minute session each day and
concepts can come from anywhere including sources like code wars and may even
include a copy of my current checkpoint work for where I am on any given day in
my bloc.io coursework.

It is also intended for me to start showing that I am coding MORE on my github
repository because with multiple commits on this one project it will show my
status as a coder as HEAVY.

My real attempt is to improve my skill development, to shorten my recall time
for basic concepts, to develop a track record on github, and on my calendar for
the actual amount of time I am writing code at the keyboard.

It may take some time to improve myself but I need to start somewhere other
than just trying to get through my bloc.io coursework.

So now I have created this repo on github so that master will include my git
commands practice...
