	<h1>Today is 20170213...</h1>

		<br>
		<h2>Today's page includes a link from a friend who I hope to share a bottle of rum with one day!!!</h2>

		<a href = "../20170212/20170212-index.html">Yesterday's Project page...</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Today's page like yesterday was started early in the day which will 
		then be followed by a period of anaylsis of what was NOT working as I 
		intended.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Then later in the day I added more content to the project for that 
		day.  I will likely do that again today and each day for a while.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Like yesterday I plan to take a portion of the Bloc.io project
		that I am currently working on and add it here...</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>timeout for lunch:  201702131215 EST...returned to work:  2017021300
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Several attempts to 'copy' files from yesterday's branch to today's
		failed over and over again.  I fear that I may not have as full command
		of Git as I would like to think.  I may need another day or two to work
		out the kinks.</p>
		<p>I plan to try it again tomorrow but in the mean time I plan to look
		at the files in the WIP folder and see what I can work on there.</p>
		<br>
		<p>timeout for snack:  201702131516 EST...return to work:  201702131522
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>As I expected this branch's version of the following file is and will
		remain different than the master branch's version of:
		/one-a-day-on-github/index.html because it does not reflect the links to
		yesterday's project pages as well as today's project pages which were 
		both added this morning before I created today's branch.</p>
		<p>I may have to delete or adjust these files on each branch...but as I
		am not planning to merge these early branches back into the master I am
		going to leave them as is and hope that the master branch's version is
		what is presented when the pages are viewed in the browser.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After a short review of this file within this branch it appears that
		this file is only visible from this branch where it's co-dated file as
		in 20170212-index.html is present in the master branch.  When I click
		on the link from the master branch's index.html file I can get to the
		file 20170212-index.html but NOT 20170213-index.html which clearly only
		resides here on branch 20170213.  My issue now is how do I get it to
		work with the link from the master branch's file of index.html which 
		has a link to it?  This will be my known issue moving forward and I hope
		that I can resolve it and fix the issue before I move to far forward.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Better question is how did this happen?  Was it part of what got all
		messed up or deleted when I was making my attempts to 'copy' files or 
		was it as a result of the 'reset HEAD' that may have caused me to loose
		the visibility to this file from the master branch?  I will be posing
		these questions to my mentor shortly hoping to get some answers.</p>
		<br>
		<p>timeout on this branch and project:  201702131608 EST.
