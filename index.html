		<h1>This was not as easy as I thought it would be...</h1>
		
		<p>I really thought I could remember the basic html structure for
		creating a simple document.  The truth is I could not and had to look
		it up.  Then my text editor decided to get into the act and as soon as
		I finished typing <!DOCTYPE html> and then <html> it decided to auto
		complete the entire template of a html structure for me.  Boy was that
		a shame.  Now I really know how little I can recall without help.  I
		hope that this exercise will change that.</p>

		<p>So now to create a saved version of this index.html file and create
		a sub directory and it's first index.html file as well.</p>

		<a href="20170212/20170212-index.html">20170212</a>
		<br>
		<a href="20170213/20170213-index.html">20170213</a>
		<br>
		<p>Link here on master branch to 20170213-index.html fails to find the
		file which clearly resides on branch 20170213 as 20170213-index.html.</p>

		<p>Sending this issue to mentor this afternoon 021702131618 EST...</p>
		<br>
		<p>Hoping that he can clone this repo and determine what I did wrong.</p>
