		<h1>This was not as easy as I thought it would be...</h1>
		
		<p>I really thought I could remember the basic html structure for
		creating a simple document.  The truth is I could not and had to look
		it up.  Then my text editor decided to get into the act and as soon as
		I finished typing <!DOCTYPE html> and then <html> it decided to auto
		complete the entire template of a html structure for me.  Boy was that
		a shame.  Now I really know how little I can recall without help.  I
		hope that this exercise will change that.</p>

		<p>So now to create a saved version of this index.html file and create
		a sub directory and it's first index.html file as well.</p>

		<a href="20170212/20170212-index.html">20170212</a>
		<br>
		<a href="20170213/20170213-index.html">20170213</a>
		<br>
		<p>Link here on master branch to 20170213-index.html fails to find the
		file which clearly resides on branch 20170213 as 20170213-index.html.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Sending this issue to mentor this afternoon 021702131618 EST...</p>
		<br>
		<p>Hoping that he can clone this repo and determine what I did wrong.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Today's call with my Bloc.io mentor had me doing a "pull" to recover
		the files.  I was not aware that doing that "pull" was going to "merge"
		my 20170213 branch into the master branch at the same time as it was
		recovering my missing 20170213-index.html file.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So while it was not as I expected it has come to pass that that one
		branch will have been merged into master.  I am going to attempt to be
		more aware of my issues today and only added those files in the branch
		that they need to be in.</p>
		<p>Thus today's link to today's folder and index.html file are here:</p>
		<a href="20170214/20170214-index.html">20170214</a>
		<br>
		<h2>20170215 Entry:</h2>
		<p>Today's entry is going to be short and accurate or at least as much
		of both of those as I can be.</p>
		<br>
		<h3><a href="20170215/20170215-index.html">20170215</a>
		<p>Today is April 8th, 2017 and it has been almost a whole month of not
		being able to code daily as I had hoped.</p><br>
		<p>This is completely unacceptable to me and has me wishing I had not 
		taken the particular program of learning that I am currently struggling
		through.</p>
		<br>
		<p>But with all this said I am pressing forward and I hope you find
		today's entry a little more fulfilling as I am hoping it will be.</p>
		<br>
		<p>And so with out any additional details have a look and see...</p>
